Standards against child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE)

At Khrog, we are committed to creating a safe and respectful environment for all users. As part of our mission to prioritize user safety, we strictly prohibit any content or activity that exploits or harms children. This policy outlines our zero-tolerance approach to child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE).

1\. **Prohibited Content and Behavior**

We do not allow:

- The sharing, storage, or distribution of explicit content involving minors, including images, videos, or text.
- Grooming or other predatory behaviors aimed at exploiting or endangering children.
- Any form of communication or activity intended to facilitate the sexual exploitation of minors.
- Attempts to evade our safety measures to engage in harmful or exploitative behavior.

2\. **Enforcement and Reporting**

Our team actively monitors for violations of this policy. If prohibited content or behavior is detected, we take immediate action, which may include:

- Removing offending content.
- Suspending or banning user accounts involved in violations.
- Reporting incidents to appropriate law enforcement authorities.

We encourage users to report any content or behavior that may violate these standards. Reports can be submitted by contacting us directly at walid.productions.apps@gmail.com.

3\. **Collaboration with Authorities**

We cooperate fully with law enforcement and child protection organizations to prevent, detect, and respond to incidents of CSAE.

4\. **Ongoing Commitment**

We continuously update our policies, tools, and systems to combat CSAE effectively. Our safety measures include advanced content moderation technologies, regular staff training, and collaboration with industry experts.
